Additional Security Recommendations

# Add Server-Side Input Sanitization:

Implement HTML sanitization for message content on the server side
Consider using a library like DOMPurify to further sanitize content

# Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System:

Create a more sophisticated permission system with defined roles and capabilities
Store role permissions in a separate table for fine-grained access control

# Add Audit Logging:

Implement a comprehensive audit log for all sensitive operations
Log user actions, especially admin actions, for accountability

# Use JWT Token Verification:

Implement additional JWT token verification for critical operations
Consider short-lived tokens for sensitive admin operations

# Consider End-to-End Encryption:

For highly sensitive chats, implement end-to-end encryption
Store message content encrypted in the database

# Regular Security Audits:

Periodically review access logs for suspicious activities
Regularly audit admin access patterns and permissions
