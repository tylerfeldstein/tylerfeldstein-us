## 🚀 AI Code Generation Requirements
✅ **Follow project structure exactly**  
✅ **Use TypeScript for all files**  
✅ **All auth logic must respect NextAuth + Convex rules**  
✅ **No API routes unless absolutely necessary**  
✅ **Frontend should use Tailwind + ShadCN**  
✅ **No Prisma, REST, or GraphQL queries**  

**⚠️ Any AI-generated code that does not follow these rules should be flagged.**
